### Step-by-step Instructions

1. Get the repository:
   - **Option A**: Clone using Git:
     1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)
     2. Navigate to where you want to download the project

   - Navigate to the project forlder, for example: `cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\Time-Tracker`

3. Create a virtual environment:
   - Type: `python -m venv venv`
   - This creates a new folder called 'venv' that will contain a separate Python installation

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **On Windows**:
     - Type: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - If successful, you'll see `(venv)` at the start of your command prompt
   
   - **On Mac/Linux**:
     - Type: `source venv/bin/activate`
     - If successful, you'll see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt

5. Install required packages:
   - Type: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - This will install all necessary dependencies for the project

## Usage üìñ
Run the application using:
```python
python run.py
```

To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:
  - Simply type: `deactivate`
  - The `(venv)` prefix should disappear

To delete the venv if no longer needed, type `rmdir /s /q venv` on Windows or `rm -rf venv` on Mac/Linux (deactivate the venv before deletion as per above). Alternatively, you can delete the venv folder in the project folder manually.
